# LC-3 SERIES OPERATIONS (CAOS)

**Purpose:** Support aircraft through its full operational and circularity lifecycle.

This phase encompasses all Computer-Aided Operations & Services (CAOS) activities that ensure the AMPEL360 BWB aircraft remains airworthy, efficient, and sustainable throughout its operational life and eventual circularity.

## Overview

LC-3 SERIES OPERATIONS (CAOS) represents the longest phase in the aircraft lifecycle, spanning from initial delivery through decades of service to eventual decommissioning and material recovery. This phase leverages digital technologies, AI/NN systems, and circular economy principles to maximize aircraft availability, minimize lifecycle costs, and achieve sustainability goals.

## Sub-Phases

### [LC-3.1 Configuration & Change Management](./LC-3.1_Configuration_Change_Management/)
Service bulletins, modifications, retrofits, upgrades, SB/AD/AMP (Airworthiness Management) alignment, fleet-level configuration intelligence (CAOS).

### [LC-3.2 MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul)](./LC-3.2_MRO_Maintenance_Repair_Overhaul/)
Scheduled & unscheduled maintenance, predictive NN-ECS, NN-FCS, NN-IMA monitoring, digital twins updated from fleet data, reliability analysis and maintenance planning.

### [LC-3.3 Customer Care & Support Services](./LC-3.3_Customer_Care_Support_Services/)
IETP / S1000D modules, technical documentation, spares, provisioning, IPC updates, operational assistance and training, cabin systems support + APAS advisory.

### [LC-3.4 PNR, Spares & Circular Material Economy](./LC-3.4_PNR_Spares_Circular_Material_Economy/)
Part Number Registry + UTCS identity, material circularity (CO₂ harvesting, recycling, DPP), Green-E batteries lifecycle integration, supply chain symbiosis (ANCHORS, ATA 85-30).
