# LC-11_0000-24 — Technology Risks

**UTCS Node:** LC-11_0000-24  
**Document Type:** Risk Assessment  
**Status:** Draft  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-12-05  
**Owner:** Risk Management & Architecture Board

---

## 1. Purpose

This document identifies and assesses Technology Risks risks for the AMPEL360 BWB Q100 concept.

---

## 2. Risk Assessment Approach

### 2.1 Risk Categories

- **Probability:** Low / Medium / High
- **Impact:** Low / Medium / High  
- **Risk Level:** Probability × Impact

### 2.2 Mitigation Strategy

For each identified risk:
- Root cause analysis
- Mitigation actions (reduce probability or impact)
- Contingency plans
- Monitoring and tracking

---

## 3. Key Risk Areas

[Detailed risk analysis to be developed during preliminary design phase]

### 3.1 High-Priority Risks

1. **Risk ID R-24-001:** [Risk description]
   - **Probability:** TBD
   - **Impact:** TBD
   - **Mitigation:** TBD

2. **Risk ID R-24-002:** [Risk description]
   - **Probability:** TBD
   - **Impact:** TBD
   - **Mitigation:** TBD

---

## 4. Risk Mitigation Summary

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Status |
|---------|------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| R-24-001 | TBD | TBD | TBD | In Progress |
| R-24-002 | TBD | TBD | TBD | Planned |

---

## 5. Monitoring and Review

- **Review Frequency:** Monthly during concept phase, weekly during detailed design
- **Escalation:** High-severity risks escalated to Architecture Board
- **Tracking:** Risk register maintained in program management system
