**UTCS Node:** LC-11_0000-07  
**Document Type:** Operational Concept  
**Status:** Draft  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-12-05  
**Owner:** Operations & Cabin Design Team

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the crew and passenger flow concept for the AMPEL360 BWB Q100, addressing boarding, deplaning, and in-flight movement within the unique BWB cabin configuration.

---

## 2. Boarding Concept

### 2.1 Door Configuration

| Door | Location | Type | Capacity | Primary Use |
|------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| **1L** | Forward Left | Type A | 110 pax | Passenger boarding (jetway) |
| **1R** | Forward Right | Type A | 110 pax | Passenger boarding (jetway) |
| **2L** | Mid Left (overwing) | Type III | 35 pax | Emergency only |
| **2R** | Mid Right (overwing) | Type III | 35 pax | Emergency only |
| **3L** | Aft Left | Type A | 110 pax | Passenger deplaning / crew access |
| **3R** | Aft Right | Type A | 110 pax | Passenger deplaning / crew access |

### 2.2 Boarding Strategy

**Dual-Door Simultaneous Boarding (Standard Operations):**
- **Door 1L and 1R:** Both forward doors used simultaneously
- **Jetways:** Dual jetway configuration at equipped gates
- **Boarding time:** Target 15-20 minutes (100 pax)

**Boarding Sequence (Zone-Based):**
1. **Zone 1:** Rows 6-10 (aft cabin) via both forward doors
2. **Zone 2:** Rows 1-5 (forward cabin) via both forward doors
3. **Pre-boarding:** Premium passengers, families, assistance-required (any door)

**Alternative (Single Jetway):**
- Use Door 1L only, sequential boarding
- Boarding time: 20-25 minutes

### 2.3 Remote Stand Operations

For non-jetway gates:
- **Ground stair access:** Doors 1L and 1R
- **Bus loading:** Passengers transported to aircraft
- **Boarding time:** 25-30 minutes (slower than jetway)

---

## 3. Deplaning Concept

### 3.1 Standard Deplaning

**Sequential Deplaning (Typical):**
- **Forward rows (1-5):** Exit via Door 1L/1R (nearest)
- **Aft rows (6-10):** Exit via Door 3L/3R (nearest)

**Dual-door deplaning:** Reduces deplaning time to ~10 minutes

### 3.2 Rapid Turnaround

For quick turnaround operations (< 30 minutes):
- **All four main doors open:** 1L, 1R, 3L, 3R
- **Parallel deplaning:** Forward and aft cabin simultaneously
- **Cabin cleaning:** Cleaning crew enters immediately after last passenger

---

## 4. In-Flight Passenger Movement

### 4.1 Aisle Configuration

**Baseline 2-3-2 Configuration:**
- **Three aisles:** Left, Center, Right
- **Aisle width:** 1.2 m (each)
- **Advantages:**
  - Passengers within 1-2 seats of an aisle (no "middle-middle" seats)
  - Superior freedom of movement vs. conventional single-aisle
  - Reduced congestion at lavatories and galleys

**Alternative 2-4-2 Configuration:**
- **Two aisles:** Left, Right
- **Aisle width:** 1.2 m (each)
- **Trade-off:** Higher density (120 pax) but reduced aisle access for center passengers

### 4.2 Movement Patterns

**Lavatory Access:**
- Forward lavatories: Accessible from all three aisles (2-3-2) or both aisles (2-4-2)
- Mid-cabin lavatories: Primary access point, reduces forward congestion
- Aft lavatories (if installed): Secondary access

**Galley Access:**
- Flight attendants use all aisles for service
- Beverage cart: Can operate in two aisles simultaneously (2-3-2 configuration advantage)

---

## 5. Crew Operations

### 5.1 Flight Deck Access

**Cockpit Entry:**
- **Location:** Forward cabin, centerline
- **Door:** Reinforced cockpit door (CS-25 §25.795 security requirements)
- **Access:** Through forward entry vestibule

**Security:**
- **Cockpit barrier:** Secure barrier between cabin and cockpit
- **Visual monitoring:** CCTV of cabin entry area
- **Access protocol:** Standard two-person rule during flight

### 5.2 Cabin Crew Stations

**Primary Stations:**
1. **Forward station:** Door 1L vicinity (lead flight attendant)
2. **Mid-cabin station (left):** Adjacent to mid-galley
3. **Mid-cabin station (right):** Adjacent to mid-galley
4. **Aft station:** Door 3L or 3R vicinity

**Crew Seating:**
- **Jump seats:** Located at each crew station (minimum 4, typical 6)
- **Takeoff/landing:** Crew seated facing aft (safety best practice)

### 5.3 Service Operations

**Meal/Beverage Service:**
- **Cart operation:** Service carts deployed from mid-galley
- **Dual-cart service:** Possible in 2-3-2 configuration (two aisles served simultaneously)
- **Service time:** Estimated 20-30 minutes (faster than single-aisle conventional)

**Cabin Preparation:**
- Pre-flight: Cabin check, safety equipment verification (15 minutes)
- Post-flight: Cabin inspection, lost items check (10 minutes)

## 6. Emergency Procedures

### 6.1 Emergency Evacuation Flow

**Evacuation Priorities:**
1. **Nearest exit rule:** Passengers directed to closest serviceable exit
2. **Wide cabin advantage:** Multiple parallel evacuation flows
3. **Crew positioning:** Flight attendants at each exit to assist

**Evacuation Sequence (Example):**
- **Rows 1-3:** Exit via Door 1L or 1R (forward)
- **Rows 4-5:** Exit via Door 2L or 2R (overwing)
- **Rows 6-8:** Exit via Door 2L or 2R (overwing)
- **Rows 9-10:** Exit via Door 3L or 3R (aft)

**Target Evacuation Time:** < 90 seconds (CS-25 §25.803 requirement)

### 6.2 Ditching and Water Landing

**Life raft deployment:**
- **Door-mounted rafts:** Type A doors (1L, 1R, 3L, 3R)
- **Capacity:** 110-person rafts (2× per raft for redundancy)
- **Deployment:** Automatic or manual activation

**Slide-raft operation:**
- Dual-lane slides from Type A exits convert to rafts
- Overwing exits (Type III) have separate life rafts

### 6.3 Medical Emergency

**Medical event response:**
- **Crew access:** Wide aisles facilitate rapid crew response
- **Passenger assistance:** Other passengers can assist without blocking aisles
- **Medical equipment:** Emergency medical kit and AED accessible from mid-galley
- **Stretcher:** If needed, wide cabin allows horizontal stretcher placement (not possible in single-aisle)

---

## 7. Cargo and Baggage Flow

### 7.1 Checked Baggage

**Cargo Doors:**
- **Forward cargo door:** Left side, forward underbelly
- **Aft cargo door:** Left side, aft underbelly

**Baggage Loading:**
- **Containers:** LD3-45 equivalent containers (smaller profile)
- **Capacity:** ~25 m³ (≈ 3 LD3 containers)
- **Loading time:** 10-15 minutes (ground crew)

**Flow:**
1. Baggage transported to aircraft via belt loader or ULD cart
2. Loaded through cargo doors into underbelly cargo hold
3. Secured with cargo nets or restraints

### 7.2 Carry-On Baggage

**Overhead Bins:**
- **Capacity:** 0.12 m³ per passenger (12-14 m³ total)
- **Typical usage:** 70-80% of passengers bring carry-on
- **Overflow:** Gate-check option for oversized bags

**Stowage:**
- Passengers stow bags in overhead bins during boarding
- Crew assists with heavy or oversized items

## 8. Turnaround Operations

### 8.1 Typical Turnaround (30-45 minutes)

**Timeline:**
- **T-0 min:** Arrival, parking at gate
- **T+2 min:** Deplaning begins (Doors 1L, 1R, 3L, 3R)
- **T+10 min:** Last passenger deplanes
- **T+12 min:** Cabin cleaning begins
- **T+20 min:** Cleaning complete, catering service
- **T+25 min:** Boarding begins
- **T+40 min:** Boarding complete, doors closed
- **T+45 min:** Pushback clearance

**Ground Services (Parallel Operations):**
- Fueling (hydrogen + electrical charging): 15-20 minutes
- Cargo unload/load: 10-15 minutes
- Cabin cleaning: 8-12 minutes
- Catering: 10 minutes
- Potable water and waste service: 5 minutes

### 8.2 Quick Turnaround (20-25 minutes)

For high-frequency operations (regional shuttle service):
- **Single cabin cleaning:** Light cleaning only
- **No catering:** Passengers pre-loaded with snacks/drinks
- **Priority boarding:** Premium passengers board first, followed by zones
- **Optimized fueling:** Partial refuel if not full mission

## 9. Ground Handling Considerations

### 9.1 Jetway Compatibility

**Standard Gates:**
- ICAO Code C gates (wingspan < 52 m) accommodate Q100 (45 m span)
- Dual-jetway gates: Preferred for simultaneous boarding (1L and 1R)
- Single-jetway gates: Standard operations via Door 1L

**Jetway Positioning:**
- **Door sill height:** ~3.5 m (typical for regional aircraft)
- **Jetway adjustment:** Standard telescoping jetways compatible

### 9.2 Ground Support Equipment (GSE)

**Required GSE:**
- Belt loaders (cargo): 2× (forward and aft cargo doors)
- Ground power unit (GPU): Electrical pre-start power
- Air conditioning unit: Ground cooling (if needed)
- Tow tractor: Pushback and towing
- Lavatory service truck: Waste removal
- Potable water truck: Freshwater replenishment

**Hydrogen Refueling:**
- **Hydrogen refueling truck:** Specialized for compressed or liquid H₂
- **Refueling point:** Aft centerbody, port side
- **Refueling time:** 15-20 minutes (1,500-2,000 kg H₂)
- **Safety zone:** Minimum 50 m exclusion zone during refueling (no ignition sources)
