## 3. Major Decisions

### CD-2024-001: BWB Configuration Selection
- **Date:** 2024-12-15
- **Decision:** Adopt full BWB configuration for Q100
- **Rationale:** 30-40% aerodynamic efficiency improvement, optimal H₂ integration
- **Alternatives:** Conventional tube-and-wing, hybrid BWB
- **Approver:** Chief Engineer
- **Impact:** All downstream design aspects

### CD-2025-002: Hydrogen-Electric Propulsion
- **Date:** 2025-01-20
- **Decision:** H₂ fuel cell + battery hybrid propulsion
- **Rationale:** Zero CO₂ emissions, adequate range capability
- **Alternatives:** Battery-only, H₂ combustion, SAF
- **Approver:** Architecture Board
- **Impact:** Energy systems, storage, thermal management

### CD-2025-003: Distributed Propulsion (8 fans)
- **Date:** 2025-04-25
- **Decision:** 8-fan distributed electric propulsion
- **Rationale:** Safety redundancy + BLI efficiency + manageable complexity
- **Alternatives:** 2, 4, 6, 10, or 12 fans
- **Approver:** Architecture Board
- **Impact:** Electrical system, aerodynamics, weight

### CD-2025-004: GH₂ Storage (350 bar)
- **Date:** 2025-07-10
- **Decision:** 350 bar compressed gaseous hydrogen for Baseline A
- **Rationale:** Mature technology, lower risk, adequate for BWB volume
- **Alternatives:** 700 bar GH₂, liquid H₂
- **Approver:** Architecture Board
- **Impact:** Tank design, safety systems, volume allocation

### CD-2025-005: Baseline A Selection
- **Date:** 2025-10-15
- **Decision:** Freeze Baseline A as primary configuration
- **Rationale:** Conservative technology assumptions minimize risk
- **Alternatives:** Baseline B (moderate risk) or C (high risk)
- **Approver:** Chief Engineer + Architecture Board
- **Impact:** All design activities, schedule, budget
