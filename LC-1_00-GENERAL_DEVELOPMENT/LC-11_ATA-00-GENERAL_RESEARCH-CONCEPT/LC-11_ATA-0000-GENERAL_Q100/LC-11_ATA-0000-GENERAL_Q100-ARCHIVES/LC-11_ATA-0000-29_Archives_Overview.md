# LC-11_ATA-0000-29 Archives Overview

## Purpose

This document provides a general overview of the Q100 concept archives, detailing what is archived, archival criteria, key freeze dates, and how to access historical artefacts.

## Scope

The LC-11_ATA-0000-GENERAL_Q100-ARCHIVES directory contains:
- Frozen baseline snapshots (Baseline 0, 1, 2, etc.)
- Superseded or obsolete concept artefacts
- Historical versions of studies, requirements, and risks
- Review decisions and decision records that are no longer active
- External reference snapshots for traceability

## Archival Criteria

Artefacts are archived when:
1. **Baseline Freeze:** A concept baseline is formally frozen and moved from active development
2. **Superseded:** An artefact is replaced by a newer version or alternative approach
3. **Obsolete:** The concept direction changes, making certain artefacts no longer relevant
4. **Completed Reviews:** Review materials and decisions are archived post-closure
5. **Historical Traceability:** Need to maintain decision provenance and audit trail

## Key Freeze Dates

| Baseline | Freeze Date | Status | Archive Reference |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Baseline 0 | TBD | Pending | LC-11_ATA-0000-34 |
| Baseline 1 | TBD | Pending | LC-11_ATA-0000-35 |
| Baseline 2 | TBD | Pending | LC-11_ATA-0000-36 |
