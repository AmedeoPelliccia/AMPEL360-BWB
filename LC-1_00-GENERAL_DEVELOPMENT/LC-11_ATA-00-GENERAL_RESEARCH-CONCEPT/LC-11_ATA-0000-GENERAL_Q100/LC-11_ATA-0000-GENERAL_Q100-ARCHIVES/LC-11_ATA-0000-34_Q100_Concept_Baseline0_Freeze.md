| MTOW | TBD | kg | TBD |
| Wing Span | TBD | m | TBD |
| Overall Length | TBD | m | TBD |
| Cruise Speed | TBD | Mach | TBD |
| Energy Source | H2/Electric hybrid | - | Concept |

## Baseline 0 Artefacts

The following artefacts are frozen as part of Baseline 0:

### Geometry and Layout
- Planform definition (LC-11_0010-05)
- Cabin layout concept (LC-11_0010-06)
- Crew and passenger flow (LC-11_0010-07)

### Mass and Performance
- Preliminary mass breakdown (LC-11_0010-09)
- Performance assumptions (LC-11_0010-10)
- Energy sizing preliminary (LC-11_0010-11)

### Integration
- Airframe integration (LC-11_0010-20)
- Propulsion integration (LC-11_0010-21)
- ECS cabin integration (LC-11_0010-22)

### Analysis and Studies
- Mission payload assumptions (LC-11_0010-08)
- Parameter bounds (LC-11_0010-18)
- Trade input assumptions (LC-11_0010-17)

## Freeze Rationale

**Reasons for Baseline 0 Freeze:**
1. Sufficient concept maturity for initial trade studies
2. Need for stable reference for parametric explorations
3. Milestone requirement for MCR-0
4. Foundation for detailed subsystem studies

## Known Limitations and Open Issues

**Major Uncertainties:**
- TBD: Aerodynamic performance validation pending
- TBD: Structural concept requires further analysis
- TBD: Systems integration details preliminary
- TBD: Manufacturing considerations not yet assessed

**Open Questions:**
- See LC-11_0010-19_Key_Open_Questions.md (version at freeze date)

## Baseline 0 Review

| Review Aspect | Status | Comments |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| Aerodynamics | TBD | Initial CFD studies pending |
| Structures | TBD | Preliminary sizing only |
| Propulsion | TBD | Concept-level definition |
| Systems | TBD | Architecture defined, details TBD |
| Operations | TBD | Mission analysis preliminary |
| Certification | TBD | Pre-study level only |

## Approval and Sign-off

| Role | Name | Signature | Date |
|------|------|-----------|------|
| Chief Engineer | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Architecture Board Chair | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Flight Sciences Lead | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Structures Lead | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## Post-Freeze Actions

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Communicate baseline freeze to all domain teams
2. Tag all frozen artefacts in version control
3. Establish change control process for Baseline 0
4. Initiate Baseline 1 development activities

**Future Evolution:**
- Baseline 1 will incorporate results of initial trade studies
- Baseline 2 will reflect refined analysis and subsystem feedback
- Subsequent baselines will progressively mature the concept
