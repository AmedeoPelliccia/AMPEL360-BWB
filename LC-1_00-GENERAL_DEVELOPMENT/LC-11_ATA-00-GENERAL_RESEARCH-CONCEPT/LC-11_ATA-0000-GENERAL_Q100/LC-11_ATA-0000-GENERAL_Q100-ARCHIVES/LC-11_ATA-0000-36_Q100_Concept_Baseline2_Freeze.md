2. All major concept trades completed and decided
3. Technology risks identified and mitigation plans in place
4. Formal gate review (MCR-2 or equivalent) completed
5. Programme readiness for next lifecycle phase (LC-14)

## Maturity Assessment

**Concept Maturity:**
- Geometry: 90%+ defined
- Mass: 80%+ confidence
- Performance: Validated within ±10%
- Systems: Architecture complete
- Operations: Use cases validated
- Certification: Pathways established

## Known Limitations and Open Issues

**Remaining Uncertainties:**
- TBD: Detail design optimization expected
- TBD: Material selection to be finalized in LC-14
- TBD: Manufacturing process details
- TBD: Supply chain development
- TBD: Test and validation program planning

**Open Questions:**
- See final LC-11_0010-19_Key_Open_Questions.md for transition items
