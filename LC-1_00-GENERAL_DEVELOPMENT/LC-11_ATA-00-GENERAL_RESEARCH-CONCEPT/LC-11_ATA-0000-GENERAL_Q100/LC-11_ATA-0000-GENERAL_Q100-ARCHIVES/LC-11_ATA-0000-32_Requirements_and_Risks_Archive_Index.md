# LC-11_ATA-0000-32 Requirements and Risks Archive Index

## Purpose

Index of archived seed requirements (REQ-SEED) and risk research artefacts that have been superseded, incorporated into formal requirements, or closed.

## Archived Seed Requirements

Reference to requirements from `LC-11_ATA-0000-GENERAL_Q100-REQ-SEED/`

| Req ID | Title | Archive Date | Original Location | Status | Disposition |
|--------|-------|--------------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| TBD | Airframe Req Seeds V1 | TBD | LC-11_REQSEED-XX | TBD | Incorporated into formal specs |
| TBD | Propulsion Req Seeds V1 | TBD | LC-11_REQSEED-XX | TBD | Superseded by updated analysis |
| TBD | ECS Req Seeds V0 | TBD | LC-11_REQSEED-XX | TBD | Evolved into system requirements |

**Archive Contents:**
- Original seed requirement documents
- Extraction rationale and linkage notes
- Assumptions and context
- Traceability to formal requirements

**Note:** Seed requirements are archived when:
1. They are incorporated into formal requirement specifications (LC-13 level)
2. They are superseded by updated concept understanding
3. They are no longer relevant due to concept changes

## Archived Risk Research

Reference to risk items from `LC-11_ATA-0000-GENERAL_Q100-RISK-RESEARCH/`

| Risk ID | Title | Archive Date | Original Location | Status | Disposition |
|---------|-------|--------------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| TBD | H2 Leak Risk V1 | TBD | LC-11_RISK-XX | TBD | Mitigation implemented / closed |
| TBD | Structural Nonlinearity Risk | TBD | LC-11_RISK-XX | TBD | Transferred to formal risk register |
| TBD | Neural Net Failsafe Risk | TBD | LC-11_RISK-XX | TBD | Study complete, risk quantified |

**Archive Contents:**
- Risk identification notes
- Risk brainstorming records
- Preliminary mitigation options
- Technology readiness assessments
- Certification risk narratives

**Note:** Risk research artefacts are archived when:
1. Risks are transferred to formal programme risk register
2. Risks are closed or mitigated
3. Technology maturity eliminates the risk
4. Concept changes make the risk irrelevant

## Traceability Notes

Archived requirements and risks maintain traceability links to:
- Concept baselines that generated them
- Formal specifications they evolved into
- Trade studies and analyses they influenced
- Review decisions they supported
