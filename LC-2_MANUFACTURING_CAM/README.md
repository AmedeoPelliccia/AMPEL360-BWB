# LC-2 MANUFACTURING (CAM)

**Purpose:** Convert design intent into certifiable production.

This phase encompasses all Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) activities required to transform validated engineering designs into physical aircraft hardware, including prototyping, testing, certification, and production preparation.

## Overview

LC-2 MANUFACTURING (CAM) bridges the gap between engineering design and series production. This phase ensures that the AMPEL360 BWB aircraft can be manufactured efficiently, meets all quality standards, and achieves certification before entering full-rate production.

## Sub-Phases

### [LC-2.1 Prototypes / Pre-Series Builds](./LC-2.1_Prototypes_PreSeries_Builds/)
Manufacturing drawings, CAM toolpaths / composite layups, jig and tooling design, assembly instructions & ergonomics, inspection and conformity documentation.

### [LC-2.2 Test Campaign & Certification](./LC-2.2_Test_Campaign_Certification/)
Ground tests (static, fatigue, pressure, systems rigs), flight-test instrumentation, FTI digital twin integration, certification reports for EASA/FAA/ICAO, conformity inspections (A, B, C), DO-160 environmental qualification.

### [LC-2.3 Final Assembly Line (FAL) & Production Planning](./LC-2.3_Final_Assembly_Line_Production_Planning/)
FAL takt time design, production work orders, configuration baselines, revision and change management (UTCS + OPT-IN), supply chain coordination, quality control & non-conformance processes.
